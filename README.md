## ðŸ§¬ AlphaFold from Scratch - Architecture Overview

This project implements a simplified version of DeepMind's **AlphaFold2** using PyTorch. The model predicts the 3D atomic structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, optionally with multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).

### ðŸ§© Component Breakdown

| Module              | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `sequence_tokenizer.py` | Tokenizes amino acid sequences into indices |
| `dataset.py` | Parses FASTA + PDB data, extracts coordinates |
| `sequence_embedding.py` | Embeds amino acids and adds positional encodings |
| `pair_embedding.py` | Initializes 2D residue-pair features |
| `evoformer.py` | Core of the model â€“ processes sequence and pair features through triangle attention and multiplication |
| `structure_module.py` | Uses invariant point attention to predict final 3D structure |
| `losses.py` | Includes FAPE, distogram loss, and torsion loss |
| `train.py` | Training loop with checkpointing and logging |
| `visualize_predictions.ipynb` | Visualizes predicted structures and distograms |

---

### ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
- PyTorch
- BioPython (for FASTA/PDB handling)
- numpy, matplotlib
- (Optional) PyMOL / Py3Dmol for 3D visualization

### ðŸ“ˆ Roadmap
See [`CHECKLIST.md`](./CHECKLIST.md) for a week-by-week implementation plan.

---

### ðŸ§ª Notes
This implementation is educational and intentionally simplified. The full AlphaFold2 model includes template processing, recycling, and more complex loss functions, which may be optionally added in future iterations.
